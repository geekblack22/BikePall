# BikePall
To bring the bicycle into our digital ecosystem we must add a number of features. We want to add the ability to know the location of our bike at all times using a gps module. This feature will be invaluable if the bike is stolen. Furthermore, this feature can be used to navigate to your desired destination as well. We will also be adding the ability to detect nearby obstacles and warn the user. This feature can be facilitated through a number of avenues. We could use our GPS or a gyro module to warn of upcoming hills, we could also use ultrasonic sensors to detect nearby obstacles and to detect when people are near the bicycle and alert the owner by sending a notification to their phone using the esp32. Also we will incorporate automatic lighting on the bike to allow for safer travel. This can best be done by using an ambient light sensor.
